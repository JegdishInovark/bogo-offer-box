# Interactive Offer Boxes: Frontend Technical Support Screening Task

## Overview

This project is a solution to the screening task for the Technical Frontend Customer Support position at Proveway Pvt Ltd. The goal was to create an interactive offer selection interface, closely matching the provided Figma design, using **only HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript**—no frameworks or libraries.

The interface features three offer boxes (1 Unit, 2 Unit, 3 Unit). Clicking any box expands it, revealing dropdowns to select size and color for each unit in the selection. Other UI elements, such as discount badges, "Most Popular" highlight, pricing, and total calculation, are also implemented as per the design.

## Files

- `index.html` – Markup for the page, with semantic structure and accessible forms.
- `styles.css` – Custom styles, including responsive design and transitions.
- `script.js` – Handles interactive box toggling and updates to UI elements.
